============

A *very* lightweight app to store notes. Notes can be sorted by date or ABC, ascending or descending. Delete them if they're no longer needed, one by one or at once.

This annoyingly user-friendly and stupid-proof app displays infos as `Toast` messages and asks for confirmation on everything. Copying a note to the device's clipboard is enabled.


The app can be used on (probably) any device that uses `Android 4.3+ (Jelly Bean, API 18)`.
